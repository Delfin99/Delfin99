Python Libraries

	- Pandas

		- Pandas helps us with munging and preparing data; it it great for operating on and maintaining structured data.

	- Scipy(Scientific Python)

		- Scipy stands on top of Numpy. With this library, we can carry out functionality like Linear Algebra, Fourier Transform, Optimization, and many others.

	- Numpy

		- NumPy (Numerical Python) is another library that lets us deal with features like linear algebra, Fourier transforms and advanced random number capabilities. One very import feature of NumPy is the n-dimensional array.

	- Matplotlib

		- Matplotlib will let you plot different kinds of graphs. These include pie charts, bar graphs, histograms, and even heat plots.

	- Scikit-learn

		- Scikit-learn is great for machine learning. It will let you statistically model and implement machine learning. The tools for these include clustering, regression, classification, and dimensionality reduction.

	- Seaborn

		- Seaborn is good with statistical data visualization. Making use of it, we can create useful and attractive graphics.

	- Scrapy

		- Scrapy will let you crawl the web. It begins on a home page and gets deeper within a website for information.

IPC

- Inter Process Communication(IPC)
- Facilitating communication between different processes.
- IPC can be offered between:
	- Related processes
	- Unrelated processes

File Streams and File Descriptiors

- If we need to perform file operations(IO) to a file, there are 2 options avaiable:
	- Streams
	- File Descriptors
- Streams are represented as File * objects.
- File descriptors are represented as objects of type int.

Pipes

- A pipe allows processes to communicate with each other (Inter Process Communication - IPC)
- A process can write date to a pipe and this can be read by another process.
- The data passes to the pipe follows the FIFO algorithm.
- The pipe has no name.
- The pipe as created by a parent process and uses it to communicate with a child process.

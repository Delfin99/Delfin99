constructor

	- default constructor

	- a constructor initializes an object when it is created

	- it has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method

	- however, constructors have no explicit return type

	- all classes have constructors, whether you define one or not, because Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes all memer variables to zero.

	- however, once you define your own constructor, the default constructor is no longer used



Instantiation 

	- the 'new' keyword is used to create the object

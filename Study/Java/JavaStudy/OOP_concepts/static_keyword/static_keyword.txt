1. Static keyword

 - static members belong to the class instead of a specific instance, this means if you make a member static, you can access it without object. 


2. Static block 

 - used for initializing the static variables. This block gets executed when the class is loaded in the memory. 


3. Static variables

 - static variables are also known as class variables.

 - unlike non-static variables, such variables can be accessed directly in static and non-static methods.

4. Static methods

 - can access class variables(static variables) without using object(instance) of the class.

 
5. Static class

 - a class can be made static only if it is a nested class.

  - nested static class doesn't need reference of outer class.

  - a static class cannot access non-static members of the outer class.

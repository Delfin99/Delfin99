Topics to cover in this report.

Review your induction period and how you are working to contribute to the company. Each company has a different way to complete induction. Some formal, and some are informal. In some cases students are giving someone to work with, or asked to work on specific issues on their own. You should describe your own experience and how this contributed to your ability to integrate into the company and potentially add value to a project or a team.


- In last two months, I joined my team and completed a few projects

- Basically, I am assigned some task from my team and they suggest small direction how this could be solved with suitable solutions including all requirements. Usually, they don't give an answer, instead they provide  really useful blogs, tutorials and documentaries which I should read to start the task.

- In other word, I have to try to do on my own first and then could ask later on if I have questions out of my knowledge or I am in big trouble for a long time

- A good point of this way for me, there is no time limit at all. So, I have enough time to consider and try something to deal with any problem from reading a book or studying essential skills on my own.

- Then, at the end, be able to find best solution. Even if it takes a long time, it is efficient way to improve problem solving ability and help to apply it in similar issue next time and of course, help to remember for a long time. I can't say that it is good for everyone but at least I learned vital experience from this.

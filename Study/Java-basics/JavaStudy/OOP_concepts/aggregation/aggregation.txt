1. aggregation

 - aggregation is a special form of association.

 - one way association.

 - "HAS-A" relationship.

 - for example, every student has an address so the relationship between student and address is a "HAS-A" relationship.

2. why we need "Aggregation"?

 - To maintain code re-usability.

 - We don't need to use the same code again and again.

 - just use the reference.

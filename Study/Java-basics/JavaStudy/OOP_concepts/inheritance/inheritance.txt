1. inheritance

 - the process by which one class acquires the properties(data members) and functionalities(methods) of another class is called "inheritance".

 - inheritance is a process of defining a new class based on an existing class by extending its common data members and methods.

 - the aim of inheritance is to provide the reusability of code so that a class has to write only the unique features and rest of the common properties and functionalities can be extended from the another class.

 - the biggest advantage of inheritance is that the code that is already present in base class(= parent, super) need not be rewritten in the child class(= derived, sub).

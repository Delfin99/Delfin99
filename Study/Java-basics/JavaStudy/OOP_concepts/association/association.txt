1. association

 - association establishes relationship between two seperate classes through their objects.

 - the relationship can be one to one, one to many, many to one, many to many.



Question. lets discuss difference between Association, Aggregation and Composition.

 - Although all three are related terms, there are some major differences in the way they relate two classes.

 - Association is a relationship between two separate classes. It joins two entirely separate entities.

 - Aggregation is a special form of association which is a unidirectional one way relationship between classes.

    - e.g) Wallet has Money but money doesn't need to have wallet necessarily so its a one directional relationship.

 - Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other.

    - e.g) Human and Heart.

1. advantage of method overriding

 - the main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

Note: In dynamic method dispatch the object can call the overriding methods of child class and all the non-overridden methods of base class but it cannot call the methods which are newly declared in the child class. In the above example the object obj2 is calling the disp(). However if you try to call the newMethod() method (which has been newly declared in Demo class) using obj2 then you would give compilation error.

2. rules of method overriding

 - argument list of overriding method(method of child class) must match the overridden method(the method of parent class).

 - access modifier of the overriding method(method of subclass) cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method of parent class.

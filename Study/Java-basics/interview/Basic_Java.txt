Basic Java Interview Questions


Q) Is Java platform independent?

- Yes, Java is a platform independent language. We can write java code on one platform and run it on another platform. For instance, we can write and compile the code on windows and can run the bytecode on Linux or any other platform. This is one of the main features of java.


Q) What all memory areas are allocated by JVM?

- Classloader: the class loader reads the .class fies and save the byte code in the method area.

- Method Area: there is only one method area in a JVM which is shared among all the classes. This holds the class level information of each .class file.

- Heap: heap is a part of JVM memory where objects are allocated. JVM creates a Class object for each .class file.

- Stack: stack is a aldo a part of JVM memory but unlike heap, it is used for storing temporary variables.

- PC Registers: This keeps the track of which instruction has been executed and which one is going to be executed. Since instructions are executed by threads, each thread has a separate PC register.

- Native Method Stack: a native method can access the runtime data areas of the virtual machine.


Q) Java VS C++?

- Platform dependency: java is platform independent while C++ is platform dependent.

- No goto support: java doesn't support while c++ does.

- Multiple inheritance: java does not while c++ supports.

- Multithreading:

- Virtual keyword:


Q) Explain public static void main(String args[])

- public: is an access modifier, which means that this method is accessible by any class.

- static: static keyword tells that this method can be accessed without creating the instance of the clas.

- void: this main method returns no value.

- main: it is the name of the method.

- String args[]: the args is an array of String type. This contains the command line arguments that we can pass while running the program.


Q) What is javac?

- The javac is a compiler that compiles the source code of your program and generated bytecode. In simple words javac produces the java byte code from the source code written *.java file. JVM executes the bytecode to run the program.


Q) What is an object?

- An object is a bundle of data and its behaviors(known as methods). 

- Objects have two characteristics: They have states and behaviors.

- States can be represented as instance variables and behaviors as methods of the class.

- Objects are created being allocated into Heap memory by JVM.


Q) What is class?

- A class can be defined as a blueprint or template or prototype from which you can create the object of that class. A class has set of properties and methods that are common to its objects.


Q) What is the base class of all classes?

- 'java.lang.Object' is the base class(super class) of all classes in java.


Q) What is a wrapper class in java?

- Wrapper classes are used for converting primitive data types into objects.

- One of the reason why we need wrapper is to use them in collections API.

- Secondly, wrapper class objects allow null values while primitive data type doesn't allow it.


Q) What is a path and classPath in java?

- Path specifies the location of .exe file. Classpath specifies the location of bytecode(.class files).


Q) What is Unicode?

- Java uses Unicode to represent the chraceters. Unicode defines a fully international character set that can represent all of the cahracters found in human languages.


Q) What are Literals?

- Any constant value that is assigned to a variable is called literal in java. For instance, 'int num = 101' // Here 101 is a literal.


Q) Dynamic Initialization?

- Dynamic initialization is process that initialization value of a variable isn't known at compile-time. It's determined at runtime to initialize the variable.


Q) What is Type casting in java?

- When we assign a value of one data type to the different data type then these two data types may not be compatible and needs a conversion.

- If the data types are compatible(for example assigning int value to long) then java does automatic conversion and does not require casting. However if the data types are not compatible then they need to be casted for conversion.

- For instance, 'double num = 10001.99; long num2 = (long)num;'


Q) What is an Array?

- An array is a collection(group) of fixed number of items. We can store multiple values of same type in an array but it can't contain multiple values of different types. For instance, an array of int type can only hold integer value.


Q) What is BREAK statement in java?

- The break statement is used to break the flow sequence in java.

- Generally, it is used with switch case data structure to come out of the statement once a case is executed.

- It can be used to come out of the loop in java.


Q) Arrays can be defined in different ways. 

- int arr[]; and int[] arr;

1. Constructors in Java

 - Constructor is a block of code that initializes the newly created object. 

 - A constructor resembles an instance method in java but it's not a method as it doesn't have a return type.

 - When we create an object, its constructor get invoked.

2. "new" keyword

 - creates an object of a class.

3. "this" keyword

 - which refers to the current object.


4. There are three types of constructors: Default, No-arg, Parameterized.

 - Default: if you do not implement any constructor in your class, Java compiler inserts a default constructor into your code.

 - No-arg: constructor with no arguments.

 - Parameterized: constructor with arguments.


5. "super"keyword

 - refers to the object of immediate parent class.

 - whenever a child class constructor gets invoked it implicitly invokes the constructor of parent class.

 - you can also say that the compiler inserts a "super()"; statement at the beginning of child class constructor.


6. Java Copy Constructor

 - A copy constructor is used for copying the values of one object to another object.

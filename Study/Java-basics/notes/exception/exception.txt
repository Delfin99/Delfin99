Exception

	- it is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program

	- it is an object which is thrown at runtime

What is exception handing

	- it is a mechanism to handle errors such as ClassNotFound, IO, SQL, Remote etc



	try 

		- used to catch exceptions that might be thrown as you program executes

		- contains set of statements where an exception can occur


	catch

		- it is where you handle the exceptions

		- a single try block can have several catch blocks associated with it

	finally

		- must execute whether an exception occurs or not



	When 'System.in.read()' is used, 'try ~ catch' must be used

	'throws' also can be used, instead of 'try ~ catch'

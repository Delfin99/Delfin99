print method / println method

	- the 'out' object of 'PrintStream' class provides several output methods

	print vs println

	print 

		- implements print

	println

		- same as print method

		- but, it include 'new line function(= \n)'


	printf

		- same as for C language

		- e.g

			System.out.printf("number use: %10d \n", 5439);

			System.out.printf("float use: %10.3f \n", 94.3852f);

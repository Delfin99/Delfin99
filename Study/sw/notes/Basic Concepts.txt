Basic Concepts

Objects

	- An abstraction of something in the problem domain, reflecting the capabilities of the system to keep information about it, ineract with it, or both

	- Abstraction

		- A form of representation that includes only what is important or interesting from a particular viewpoint, hiding the features deemed irrelevant for the current study

		- e.g. a map, engieering drawing, analyst representation of data...

	- Purpost of Objects

		- They promote understanding of the real world

		- Provide a practical basis for computer implementation

	- Characteristics of Objects

		- State

		- Behaviour

		- Identity

Modelling the Class Hierarchy for Student and GradStudent

	- Class Diagram

		- This diagram may contain additional information 

			e.g. the types of attributes, the signatureof methods, etc

		- Simple methods such as get and set methods are not usually shown on the diagram.

		- A class diagram is intended to give a clear picture of the classes in a system and the relationships between those


The "is a" relationship

	- GradStudent extends the Student class

	- We can say that a GradStudent "is a" Student

	- This means we can refer to GradStudent objects as Student objects

	- This has important implications

More Inheritance Terms

	- The superclass(Student) is sometimes called a generalisation and the subclass (GradStudent) is somethies called a specialisation.

	- The terms base class and derived class are also used for the superclass and subclass, respectively

		e.g. 

			Generalisation = base class = superclass

			Specialisation = derived class = subclass

A Simple Class Diagram

	- First compartment contains the name of the class

	- Second compartment contains the attributes(data) that an object of type BankAccount can have

The Object Model

	- The object model is a general way of thinking about the structure of 00 programs

	- The fundamental property of the object model is that computation takes place in and between objects

	- The object model is the common computational model shared by UML and OOP language


Role of an Object's Data and Methods
	- Third compartment contains the operations that an object of type BankAccount can perform

	*note1: accessor and mutator(= getter and setter simply) are not generally modelled

	*note2: In the diagram above, the red squares on the attributes denote that the attributes are private(a minus sign, "-", can also denote this). The green circles on the operations denote that they are public(a plus sign, "+", can also denote this)

Object Links

	- The actual link is provided by the references(circleA and circleB) within the client object - interestingly, this means that only the client "knows" about the link. 

	- In this sense, the link is uni-directional

	*note3: 

		- Compile-time: the time period in which you, the developer, are compiling your code

		- Run-time: the time period which a user is running your piece of software

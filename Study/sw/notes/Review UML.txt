Review UML

Unified Modeling Language

UML Definition of Class

	- A Class is a description of a set of objects that share attribute, operations(behaviours), relationship with other objects

	- The purpose of a class is to declare a collection of operations, and attributes that fully describe the structure and behaviour for all obejcts of that class

UML Definition of Object

	- An Object is an instance that originates from a class;

	- It is structured and behaves according to its class

Generalisation

	- UML Definition:

		- Hierarchical relationship between a more general element and a more specific element that is fully consistent with the first element and that adds additional information

Generalisation in Object Classes

	- Arrange real world object classes into hierarchies

	- Models the difference and similarity between classes

Generalisation in Object Classes - Inheritance

	- When two classes are arranged in a hierarchy the more specialised class(subclass) will inherit all the characteristics from the more generalised class(superclass)

	- The subclass will have at least one additional detail not inherited from its superclass

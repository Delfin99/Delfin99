1. What is Cloud Computing?

2. Before Cloud Computing?

3. Utilizing cloud Computing?

	- Software is flexible.
	- If your needs change, your software can change much more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively than your hardware.

4. Three Models of Cloud Computing

	- IaaS (= Infrastructure as a Service) : Network Architects

	- PaaS (= Platform as a Service) : Application Developers

	- SaaS (= Software as a Service) : End Users

5. Three Cloud Deployment Models

6. Cloud versus On-Premises

7. What can you do in the cloud?

	- Application Hosting
	- Backup and Storage
	- Content Delivery
	- Websites
	- Enterprise IT
	- Databases

8. On-Premises and AWS Comparison

9. Important Cloud Terminology

	- High Availability(Highly Available): Accessible when you need it.

	- Fault Tolerance(Falut Tolerant): Ability to withstand a certain amount of failure and still remain functional.

	- Scalability(Scalable): Ability to easily grow in size, capacity, and/or scope when required. Growth is (usually) based on demand.

	- Elasticity(Elastic): Ability to grow(scale) when required and to reduce in size when resources are no longer needed.


10. Summary

	1) Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources online with pay-as-you-go pricing.

	2) Three models of cloud computing are:

		- IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service)
		- PaaS(Platform as a Service)
		- SaaS(Software as a Service)

	3) Three cloud deployment models:

		- All-in cloud
		- Hybrid
		- Private cloud(On-Premises)

	4) Cloud services are available to replace traditional on-premises computing activities.

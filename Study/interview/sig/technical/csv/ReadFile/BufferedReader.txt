Method 1: Using readLine() method of BufferedReader class.

public String readLine() throws IOException

It reads a line of text.

Method 2: Using read() method

public int read() throws IOException

It reads a character of text. Since it returns an integer value, it needs to be explicitly cast as char for reading the content of file.

Complete example

Here I have two txt files myfile.txt and myfile2.txt. In order to demonstrate both the ways to read file. I'm reading first file using readLine() method while the second file is being read using read() method.

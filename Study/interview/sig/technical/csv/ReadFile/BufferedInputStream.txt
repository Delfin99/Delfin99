In this example we will see how to read a file in java using FileInputStream and BufferedInputStream. Here are the detailed steps that we have taken in the below code:

1) Created a File instance by providing the full path of the file(which we will read) during File Object creation.

2) Passed the file instance to the FileInputStream which opens a connection to the actual file, the file named by the File object file in the file system.

3) Passed the FileInputStream instance to BufferedInputStream which creats a BufferedInputStream and saves its arguments, the input stream in, for later use. An internal buffer array is created and stored in buf using which the read operation gives good performance as the content is readily available in the buffer.

4) Used while loop to read the file. Method available() is used for checking the end of the file as it returns 0 when the pointer reaches to the end of the file. Read the file content using read() method of FileInputStream.

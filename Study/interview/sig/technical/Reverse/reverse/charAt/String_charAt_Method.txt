The method charAt(int index) returns the character at the specified index. Then index value shoud lie between 0 and length()-1. 

For e.g. s.charAt(0) would return the first character of the string "s". It throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is less than zero or greater than equal to the length of the string (index < 0 || index >= length()).

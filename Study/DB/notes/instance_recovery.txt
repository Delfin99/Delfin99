redo thread(redo log data)

 - a record of all the changes generated by an instance.

when a transaction is committed, LGWR writes both the remaining redo entries in memory and the transaction SCN to the online redo log. 

However, DBWR process writes modified data blocks to the data files whenever it is most efficient. 

For this reason, uncommitted changes may temporarily exist in the data files while committed changes do not yet exist in the data files.

 - Data blocks committed by a transaction are not written to the data files and appear only in the online redo log. These changes must be reapplied to the data files.

 - The data files contains changes that had not been committed when the instance failed. These changes must be rolled back to ensure transactional consistency.


Instacne recovery use only online redo log files and current online files to synchronize the data files and ensure that they are consistent.
